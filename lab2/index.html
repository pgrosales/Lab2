        	<h5><b>Hello There!</b> </h5>
        
            <p>I’m Patrick Rosales and I’m 19 years old and, I live at Merville, Pasay City. During the first year of my Senior High, I’m not used in going somewhere alone, so I am nervous because it will be my first time travelling/commuting alone going to Asia Pacific College, so I think I can say that the nervousness I felt is an indicator that I kind of traveled by myself to place I can consider new for me. After staying in APC during my senior high school days, My friends and I, had a summer outing by ourselves, it was my first time going on a beach without my family, I was scared because we commuted by just following direction we found on the internet so I was nervous the whole time because I think that we might get lost, but fortunately, we didn’t, so for me I think that I had an unexpected adventure with my friends because I was able to do the things that I’m not used to. </p>
                <p>
            My freshman year did go smoothly since I had credited subjects, so my subject load wasn’t that big and since the first year was more on general subjects, i had an idea since i took senior high here, so i was able to do advanced readings. I was able to relax and have fun with my friends. I spent my summer at home, playing games, eating, and sleeping, so I think that is enough for me because I prefer to maximize the vacation by relaxing at home, some would say that my summer is boring, but I am satisfied with what I’ve done the whole summer. Some would define summer vacation, as travelling, but I say that would depend in the person. Since I usually try to avoid asking money from my parents, i would only accept invitations if I have any spare money. The feelings I felt when I experienced those things I’ve mentioned are: nervousness and happiness, Since I usually have a good time with my friends, and we’ve been together for years, I am usually happy with them. I can say that I’m an optimist person, so sad/depressing things rarely affects me. 

            I expect this class to be fun because this includes designing which is one of my interests, I also expect this class to be also hard because this subject is I think is a fundamental part of my course as BSIT-MI since designing would be a vital part of making a program.

                <p>My most used application as of now is Netflix. This application sorts the series or movies depending on their genres.  I usually spend my time watching any series that I find interesting while I’m going through the app. I liked it because it offers a wide variety of series or movies that I can watch. And the thing I most liked about this is that it doesn’t have an advertisement that pop ups out of nowhere unlike other video streaming apps, so I can watch smoothly without any interruptions. I can also download contents on my phone so I can watch it anywhere and since I usually get stuck on traffic I can watch it so I won’t get bored while I’m waiting It also has a feature that when you’re after watching a certain series or movies, it will show a related content that might make the user to watch more. The price for this is 550 pesos for premium subscription. I can say that the price is justified by basing from the contents it offers and you’re just required to pay monthly and you can share one account with up to 4 people so that you can divide the price, so you can fully take advantage of the price. The only thing that I find disappointing is that Netflix offers different contents depending on the country so some movies or series might not be available here, but it is available on other country due to licensing deals but this is the only thing that I dislike about the whole app. </p>

          <p>
            Designing an elevator which can go as high as 1000 floor is hard, by taking capacity, speed, reliability, into factor can be hard, but since this is just theoretically, I designed an elevator which can cater up to 70 people each trip. I divided 1000 floors into 4 elevators. First elevator is from 1st to 250th, next is 250th to 500th, then 500th to 750th and lastly from 750th to 1000th floor.  My designed elevator is operated by keycard for security, accessing the elevator and for observing the capacity of the elevator. For example, a person used their keycard to operate the elevator a capacity counter will count each keycard used in operating the elevator. The elevator also has a weight counter, because the capacity of the elevator isn’t exactly considering the persons: weight, and items they’re with. So even the capacity states that the capacity hasn’t reached 70 yet, but the weight counter determined that the elevator reached its limit, the keycard reader won’t accept any keycards anymore. The interface consists of numbers for inputting the desired floor, the screen also indicates which floors the certain elevator can go up to. When the users have done entering their desired floor, a pop up will show asking if the number input is correct to avoid the elevator to stop at wrong floors and can waste time.

              <h1> Need Finding </h1> </center>
<b>Problems:</b>
 <li>Students who commit offenses (major and minor) doesn’t meet the consequences of their action.</li>
<li> Students lack in participation when it comes to violation reports.</li>
<li> Students tend to keep quiet when their friends violate rules.</li>
 <li>Reporting directly through the discipline office can be a hassle for the students and they are afraid to expose their identity.</li>
<li> Students are unaware of how many offenses they already accumulated/committed.</li>
<li> Students didn’t know if their report for some faulty equipment was acknowledged.</li>
 <li>Problems/Offenses inside the school campus is not reported to the different offices that handles certain issues. </li>
<li> Students tend to ignore issues in the school campus. </li>
 <li>Minor issues/offences lead to bigger problems.</li>
<li> Noticed damages on equipment may lead to unusable equipment if not reported immediately </li>

<b>Needs:</b>
 <li>Fairness to all students. Student who violate should be sanctioned accordingly.</li>
<li> An easy way to report violation without risking the student’s identity.</li>
<li> Send reports regarding any problems/issues to the different offices. </li>
<li> Decrease any problems/issues in the school campus.</li>
 <li>Encourages students to be aware and knowledgeable to different problems. </li>

<b>Solution:</b>
 Create a mobile application for the users to capture, compile, and send evidences about a problem that strengthens their report to the different offices that handles certain issues. 
 <li>1.  The application will be a platform for sending emails with pictures (optional) regarding the problem to a certain office. 
 Major and Minor Offenses reports are to be send to Discipline Office
 Faulty room equipment reports are to be send to Building Admin Office
 Faulty hardware or software reports are to be send to the ITRO</li>
<li>2.  The application will indicate the subject of the problem to be specific in identifying the problem and compiling about that certain issue. 
 Create a web application for the different offices to view the reports about different issues sent by different users in the school campus </li>
<li>1.  The web application will be the platform of the offices on viewing the sent problems by different users. </li>
<li>2.  The application will sort the problem base on the minor offences/issues or major offences/issues.</li>
<li>3.  The offices will reply to the sender if the report was already acknowledged or fixed.</li>
<b>Why do we need to solve this problem? </b>
 <li>To maintain the quality and the effectivity of the education/facilities/ </li>
 <li>To reduce the problems/issues that may have a long-term effect of each individual </li>
 <li>To make other students be aware of what is happening in the school campus. </li>
 <li>To encourage students to help one another in reporting/solving a problem. </li>

<b>How did we notice this problem? </b>
 <li>Some problems/issues were not aided/solved until now. </li>
 <li>Problems/issues that seem to be low are being ignored. </li>
 <li>No one has the strength in reporting different kinds of problem (whether it would be a major or minor offense). </li>

<b>What were other options you considered, and why did you choose this solution?</b>
 <li>The usual option we considered was to report a problem directly to the Disciplinary Office using the Microsoft Outlook, but that can be dumped by other emails so we thought of different solutions. </li>
<li> We chose this solution to raise awareness inside the school campus and to give a voice to the students who sees a problem. </li>
 <li>We think that in this solution, we can solve numerous cases/issues/problems because it is easier to send a report to the Disciplinary Office.</li>

<b>Example 1:</b>
Your friends keep on cheating during major exams (midterms and finals). As an honor student, they keep on asking your answers and you cannot decline them since they are your friends. You feel violated and you think it is unfair that they got the score that they didn’t deserve. You are afraid to report them to the guidance office because they will know who reported them. You don’t want them to know that you are the one who reported them but you can’t stand what they are doing. What would you do about this?
With the help of this application, you were able to report your friends without risking your identity. You logged in using your APC account. You secretly take a video on your friends while they are cheating on a quiz. You uploaded the video and sent it to the Discipline Office. Only the Discipline Office can see and view the reports that were submitted. You friends were called by the Discipline Office and sanctioned them accordingly for the major offense that they violate. They didn’t know who reported them. By reporting them to the Disicipline Office, you helped remained the integrity of the school and helped enhanced the quality of school.


<b>Example 2:</b>
Before you go home from a class, you noticed that the aircon inside your classroom suddenly produced a cracking sound inside it. You don’t know where to report it, either from the guards, discipline office, building admin, or the guidance office. 
With the application, you captured a video of the aircon in which you can hear the cracking sound. You sent your report to the application. The next day you were in the different class, you didn’t know if the aircon that you report was fixed. You decided to check it if it was already fixed. Before going to the room, suddenly your phone received a notification. It was a notification from the Building Admin that your report was acknowledge and was already fixed.

                <p>The class atmosphere this week is even lighter compared to last week, I’ve learned more things about this subject. Thinking of an application might sound easy but considering every aspect such as problems, possible solution, how will it be implemented, designs, are exhausting.  We also had a chance to think thoroughly, considering everything that can affect our desired project. I think this class is being better every week that past.  Being able to think intensively while having someone to guide us is good enough for me to say that I am currently satisfied with how the way things are right now. There’s also a lot of materials that we can learn from accessible anywhere, so the learning is not limited to our classroom. I wish the atmosphere will stay till the end of the term.</p>

                <p>This week’s task to create a Web application was kind of hard for me since the last time I programmed using HTML was years ago so I had a hard time doing a website that suits my preferences, so I had to check some tutorials on the internet to do a certain thing on my web app. The hardest obstacle that I’ve encountered is adjusting the images so that It wont look like as if it is shouting, although I find it hard to adjust, I’ve just scratched that idea and started to make a new design on my L2 which is to use Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript. I am familiar with the terms but it is still hard for me to find what would I really like because ideas just keep coming so I had to change a certain thing again and again so this task is time consuming for me although I am having fun while doing this. Uploading to GitHub and making my app run in Heroku did go smoothly, but the results aren't that good. The valuable thing I’ve learned while doing this task is it is okay to keep changing ideas because exploration of concept is good, it might be time consuming but at the same time I am learning, and I can use the ideas that I didn’t use as a future reference. Also, this task made me aware that I need to study more about HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript since I had to rely on the internet to do my task.</p>

        <div class="row media">
        	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3 col-md-3 col-lg-3">
            	<div class="expertiesico">
                	Fouth Week of<br>User Design
                </div>
            </div>
        	<div class="expertiesdesc col-xs-12 col-sm-9 col-md-9 col-lg-9">
            	
                <p>First thing is that this practice is basically an experience when dealing with an incorrect way of doing a website which really helped me be aware of the things I should avoid when doing a website. I felt irritated the whole time because of the misleading designs which kind of gave me a hard time while doing this but at the same time I’ve been more aware of the things I should and should not do in designing. Also this activity really informed me that reading is fundamental, anyone can finish this when they know how to read and just use their common sense although it took me 9 minutes at my trial but at my second trial I’ve finished the practice in less than 3 minutes. The most annoying part is the verification part because it is tiring to click all the same pictures just for verification also the terms and condition part is irritating because of the slow scrolling speed but I used a trick in speeding it but if I wasn’t able to know that trick, it might make me more irritated than I really am while doing that UI practice.
Basically this activity is just to make us learn about doing the correct way in designing, I am hoping for more activity like this because it is challenging and informative.
