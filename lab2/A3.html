<h2>
	Designing an elevator which can go as high as 1000 floor is hard, by taking capacity, speed, reliability, into factor can be hard, but since this is just theoretically, I designed an elevator which can cater up to 70 people each trip. I divided 1000 floors into 4 elevators. First elevator is from 1st to 250th, next is 250th to 500th, then 500th to 750th and lastly from 750th to 1000th floor.  My designed elevator is operated by keycard for security, accessing the elevator and for observing the capacity of the elevator. For example, a person used their keycard to operate the elevator a capacity counter will count each keycard used in operating the elevator. The elevator also has a weight counter, because the capacity of the elevator isn’t exactly considering the persons: weight, and items they’re with. So even the capacity states that the capacity hasn’t reached 70 yet, but the weight counter determined that the elevator reached its limit, the keycard reader won’t accept any keycards anymore. The interface consists of numbers for inputting the desired floor, the screen also indicates which floors the certain elevator can go up to. When the users have done entering their desired floor, a pop up will show asking if the number input is correct to avoid the elevator to stop at wrong floors and can waste time. 
	On the inside, the keycard reader is gone, the interface shows the current floor, the next floor stop, open and close buttons, and emergency button. Since 250 floors can take a long time, I put a music feature to entertain the users. There is also a screen which indicates the song that currently plays, and next songs to be played. The elevator itself will be divide into four spaces.  There will be a certain spot in which the users should be. For example, I used the elevator to go to 245th floor, there will be a spot for me that I should go. Let’s consider it as Spot 4. Spot 4 are for the persons who will go from 186th to 250th floor. Spot 1 for 1st to 65th floor, Spot 2 is for 65th to 129th floor and spot 3 is for 129th to 193th floor. This can remove the problem for the users when they’re about to go outside. Given the usual problem in a common elevator in which the person who’s about to go outside the elevator, is on the furthest from the entrance, this will take time and inconvenience to all of them. By implementing this, it will make the process smooth.
	The speed would be a problem for my elevator, since it can’t just accelerate because some users might be going outside to floors not far from each other so acceleration for this is a major problem. For this problem, I think there has yet to be a solution for this, but for now, I will just use the common pulley feature of a common elevator.
