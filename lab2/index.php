        	<h5>Hello There! </h5>
        
            <p>I’m Patrick Rosales and I’m 19 years old and, I live at Merville, Pasay City. During the first year of my Senior High, I’m not used in going somewhere alone, so I am nervous because it will be my first time travelling/commuting alone going to Asia Pacific College, so I think I can say that the nervousness I felt is an indicator that I kind of traveled by myself to place I can consider new for me. After staying in APC during my senior high school days, My friends and I, had a summer outing by ourselves, it was my first time going on a beach without my family, I was scared because we commuted by just following direction we found on the internet so I was nervous the whole time because I think that we might get lost, but fortunately, we didn’t, so for me I think that I had an unexpected adventure with my friends because I was able to do the things that I’m not used to. </p>
                <p>
            My freshman year did go smoothly since I had credited subjects, so my subject load wasn’t that big and since the first year was more on general subjects, i had an idea since i took senior high here, so i was able to do advanced readings. I was able to relax and have fun with my friends. I spent my summer at home, playing games, eating, and sleeping, so I think that is enough for me because I prefer to maximize the vacation by relaxing at home, some would say that my summer is boring, but I am satisfied with what I’ve done the whole summer. Some would define summer vacation, as travelling, but I say that would depend in the person. Since I usually try to avoid asking money from my parents, i would only accept invitations if I have any spare money. The feelings I felt when I experienced those things I’ve mentioned are: nervousness and happiness, Since I usually have a good time with my friends, and we’ve been together for years, I am usually happy with them. I can say that I’m an optimist person, so sad/depressing things rarely affects me. 

            I expect this class to be fun because this includes designing which is one of my interests, I also expect this class to be also hard because this subject is I think is a fundamental part of my course as BSIT-MI since designing would be a vital part of making a program.

                <H2>Favorite Application</H2>
                	<p> My most used application as of now is Netflix. This application sorts the series or movies depending on their genres.  I usually spend my time watching any series that I find interesting while I’m going through the app. I liked it because it offers a wide variety of series or movies that I can watch. And the thing I most liked about this is that it doesn’t have an advertisement that pop ups out of nowhere unlike other video streaming apps, so I can watch smoothly without any interruptions. I can also download contents on my phone so I can watch it anywhere and since I usually get stuck on traffic I can watch it so I won’t get bored while I’m waiting It also has a feature that when you’re after watching a certain series or movies, it will show a related content that might make the user to watch more. The price for this is 550 pesos for premium subscription. I can say that the price is justified by basing from the contents it offers and you’re just required to pay monthly and you can share one account with up to 4 people so that you can divide the price, so you can fully take advantage of the price. The only thing that I find disappointing is that Netflix offers different contents depending on the country so some movies or series might not be available here, but it is available on other country due to licensing deals but this is the only thing that I dislike about the whole app. </p>

                <p>The class atmosphere this week is even lighter compared to last week, I’ve learned more things about this subject. Thinking of an application might sound easy but considering every aspect such as problems, possible solution, how will it be implemented, designs, are exhausting.  We also had a chance to think thoroughly, considering everything that can affect our desired project. I think this class is being better every week that past.  Being able to think intensively while having someone to guide us is good enough for me to say that I am currently satisfied with how the way things are right now. There’s also a lot of materials that we can learn from accessible anywhere, so the learning is not limited to our classroom. I wish the atmosphere will stay till the end of the term.</p>

                <p>This week’s task to create a Web application was kind of hard for me since the last time I programmed using HTML was years ago so I had a hard time doing a website that suits my preferences, so I had to check some tutorials on the internet to do a certain thing on my web app. The hardest obstacle that I’ve encountered is adjusting the images so that It wont look like as if it is shouting, although I find it hard to adjust, I’ve just scratched that idea and started to make a new design on my L2 which is to use Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript. I am familiar with the terms but it is still hard for me to find what would I really like because ideas just keep coming so I had to change a certain thing again and again so this task is time consuming for me although I am having fun while doing this. Uploading to GitHub and making my app run in Heroku did go smoothly, but the results isn’t that good. The valuable thing I’ve learned while doing this task is it is okay to keep changing ideas because exploration of concepts is good, it might be time consuming but at the same time I am learning, and I can use the ideas that I didn’t use as a future reference. Also, this task made me aware that I need to study more about HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript since I had to rely on the internet to do my task.</p>

                <p>First thing is that this practice is basically an experience when dealing with an incorrect way of doing a website which really helped me be aware of the things I should avoid when doing a website. I felt irritated the whole time because of the misleading designs which kind of gave me a hard time while doing this but at the same time I’ve been more aware of the things I should and should not do in designing. Also this activity really informed me that reading is fundamental, anyone can finish this when they know how to read and just use their common sense although it took me 9 minutes at my trial but at my second trial I’ve finished the practice in less than 3 minutes. The most annoying part is the verification part because it is tiring to click all the same pictures just for verification also the terms and condition part is irritating because of the slow scrolling speed but I used a trick in speeding it but if I wasn’t able to know that trick, it might make me more irritated than I really am while doing that UI practice.
Basically this activity is just to make us learn about doing the correct way in designing, I am hoping for more activity like this because it is challenging and informative.
